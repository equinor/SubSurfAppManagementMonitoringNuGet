# Contributing changes

This repository is designed to help us (the amplify team) standardize API health checks and send the required telemtry for monitoring purposes.
Improvements and fixes to all of the projects that we develop and maintain. This repository was created with the intent to be developed by us and used by us. This means that we prefer not to get pull requests on code changes. If there are any input or feedback it should be submitted as an issue to this repository.
